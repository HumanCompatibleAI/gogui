    <h1>Interrupting commands</h1>

    <p>
      Commands can be interrupted, if the Go program supports it.
      The program indicates that it can handle INT signals
      by implementing the <code>gogui_sigint</code> command
      and returning its process ID.
      <br>
      If the Interrupt button on the toolbar is pressed,
      GoGui will send a INT signal to the program.

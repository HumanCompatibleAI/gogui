    <h1>Interrupting commands</h1>

    <p>
      Commands can be interrupted, if the Go program supports it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      There are two ways of sending the interrupt signal to the program:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
	If the program can handle INT signals, it indicates this
	by implementing the <code>gogui_sigint</code> command
	and returning its process ID.
	GoGui will then send an INT signal to the process if the user
	presses th interrupt button.
      </li>
      <li>
	If the program does not implement <code>gogui_sigint</code>,
	GoGui will send a special comment line (<code># interrupt</code>)
	to the program.
	If the program reads the GTP input stream
	while processing a command, it can interrupt the command.
	Programs not aware of this convention will simply ignore
	the interrupt comment line.
      </li>
    </ol>

<title>Analyze Commands</title>
  
<para>
GoGui allows to define analyze commands.
An analyze command is sent to the Go program and the response is displayed
graphically on the board.
</para>
  
<para>
Analyze commands are defined in the
configuration file <userinput>~/.gogui/analyze-commands</userinput>.
All files beginning with <userinput>~/.gogui/analyze-commands</userinput>
are loaded.
If none exists, a default file is created.
There is one line per command in the format:
</para>
  
<blockquote>
<simpara>
<userinput>
type/label/command[/section[/scale]]
</userinput>
</simpara>
</blockquote>

<title>Types</title>
<para>
The command type determines what format the response is expected to be and
how it is interpreted and displayed.
It can be one of the following:

<variablelist>

<varlistentry>
<term><userinput>bwboard</userinput></term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
The response of the command is a board of strings.
Strings "b" or "black" will be displayed as black,
"w" or "white" as white, all other strings are not displayed.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><userinput>cboard</userinput></term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
The response of the command is a board of strings with color names.
They will be displayed as background colors for the fields.
Valid color names are black, blue, cyan, green, gray, magenta,
pink, red, white and yellow.
Unknown names or the special string "" are ignored.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><userinput>dboard</userinput></term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
The response of the command is a board of floating point
numbers that represent influence data.
They will be displayed as black (positive) and white (negative)
squares on the board.
The maximum size of a square is such that the corner would touch
the edge of a stone on that field and the edge length of the
square is proportional to the floating point number.
The numbers are expected to be between -1 and 1.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><userinput>hstring</userinput></term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
The response is a multi-line text and will be displayed in a window
using syntax highlighting.
Lines beginning with a word followed by a colon are displayed in bold,
points and moves in blue, the strings "black" and "white" in purple,
numbers in green and words that are completely uppercase in red.

the selected text are marked on the board.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><userinput>sboard</userinput></term>

<title>Command</title>
<para>
The command to send to the Go program.
It can contain one of the following wildcards:
<variablelist>

<varlistentry>
<term><userinput>%c</userinput></term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Will be replaced by a color that can be selected in the analyze window
and defaults to the color which is to play.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><userinput>%f</userinput></term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Will be replaced by a filename entered by the user.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><userinput>%m</userinput></term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Will be replaced by the color to play.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><userinput>%o</userinput></term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
This wildcard is for commands that take an optional string argument and can
be used for querying or setting a parameter of the Go program.
The command should return the current value of the parameter if no argument
is given and set the parameter to the argument otherwise.
The command will be run first without an argument to retrieve the current
value which is used as default value in an input box presented to the
user.
If the user changes the value, the command will be run with the new value
as an argument to set the parameter.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><userinput>%p</userinput></term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Will be replaced by the a point selected by the user.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><userinput>%P</userinput></term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Will be replaced by a list of points selected by the user.
The points are selected by clicking on the board.
The last point of the list is selected either by clicking with the
<keycap>Ctrl</keycap> key pressed, double-clicking or using the right
mouse button.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><userinput>%s</userinput></term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Will be replaced by an argument entered by the user.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

</variablelist>
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Section</title>
<para>
The response to the command is searched first until a single line
containing the section name followed by a colon is found.
The text following from the next line on is parsed as the actual response.
</para>
<warning>
<simpara>
Using section headers is deprecated and will not be supported in the future.
It is recommended that Go engines output only one of the response types
described above.
</simpara>
</warning>
</section>

<section>
<title>Scale</title>
<para>
If the type is <userinput>dboard</userinput>, the numbers are scaled by
this factor.
</para>
<warning>
<simpara>
Using scaling factors is deprecated and will not be supported in the future.

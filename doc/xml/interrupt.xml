Commands can be interrupted, if the Go program supports it.

There are two ways of sending the interrupt signal to the program:

The Go program reads the GTP input stream while processing a command and can
interrupt the current command if the special comment line
<userinput>#&#160;interrupt</userinput> is received.
The Go program indicates this ability by implementing the command
<userinput>gogui_interrupt</userinput>.
</listitem>
<listitem>
The alternative way is that the program can handle INT signals.
It indicates this by implementing the <userinput>gogui_sigint</userinput>
command and returning its process ID.
GoGui will then send an INT signal to the process
by invoking the shell command
<userinput>kill -INT <replaceable>pid</replaceable></userinput>.
However this will work only on UNIX systems and lacks the feature of
transmitting interrupt signals over network GTP streams.

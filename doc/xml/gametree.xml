<title>Game tree window</title>

<para>
The game tree window shows all variations of the current game as a graph
of nodes.
</para>
<para>
Nodes are displayed as a black or white stone with a move number,
if the node contains a move, a symbol containing four small stones for nodes
containing setup stones or a gray diamond for other nodes.
Nodes that contain a comment have 3 small black lines under the node.
The current node is marked with a red cursor.
</para>
<para>
If a node is clicked on, the shortest path from the current node to the
target node is computed and a series of <userinput>undo</userinput>
and <userinput>play</userinput> commands is sent to the Go program
to go there.

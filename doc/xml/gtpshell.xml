<title>Commands altering the board state</title>
<para>
It is not advisable to send GTP commands directly to the Go program
that alter the board state, since it will cause
the graphical board to be out of sync with the Go program.
For standard GTP commands that alter the board state, GoGui will
show a warning.

<title>Saving the history</title>

From the menu of the GTP shell window it is possible to save
the GTP commands and responses or only the commands to a file.
Note that the history of the GTP streams will be truncated
depending on the values of <userinput>gtpshell-history-min</userinput>
and <userinput>gtpshell-history-max</userinput> in the configuration
file <filename>~/.gogui/config</filename>.

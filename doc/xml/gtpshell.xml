The GTP shell is a window that allows to trace the
stream of GTP commands and responses that are sent to and
received from the Go program.

<title>Commands altering the board state</title>
<para>
It is not advisable to send any GTP commands to the Go program
directly that alter the board state, since it will cause
the graphical board to be out of sync with the Go program.

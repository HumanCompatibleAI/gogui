  <title>The GTP shell</title>
  
  <para>
    The GTP shell is a window that allows to trace the
    stream of GTP commands and responses that are sent to and
    received from the Go program.
    Also, it allows to enter any command and send it to the Go program.
    <warning>
      <para>
	It is not advisable to send any GTP commands to the Go program
	directly that alter the board state, since it will cause
	the graphical board to be out of sync with the Go program.
      </para>

  <para>
    From the menu of the GTP shell window it is possible to save
    the GTP commands and responses or the commands only to a file.
    Note that the history of the GTP streams will be truncated
    depending on the values of <userinput>gtpshell-history-min</userinput>
    and <userinput>gtpshell-history-max</userinput> in the configuration
    file <filename>~/.gogui/config</filename>.

<title>Rendering errors in the GTP shell</title>
<para>
Rendering errors in the GTP shell window occur which disappear after manually
resizing the window.
This is probably a bug in the Java libraries.
With Java 1.4.2 for Linux this problem seems to have disappeared after
introducing a workaround which resets the window size after each text update.
With other Java versions or on other systems the problem can still exist.

<title>Command completions in the GTP shell are hiding text entry</title>
<para>
The pop up window with automatic command completions sometimes hides the
text entry when typing.
This is a problem in some implementations of the Java 1.4 libraries.
You can disable automatic command completion from the GTP shell menu.

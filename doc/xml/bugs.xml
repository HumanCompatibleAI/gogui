<title>Rendering errors in the GTP shell</title>
<para>
Rendering errors in the GTP shell window occur which disappear after manually
resizing the window.
This is probably a bug in the Java libraries.
With Java 1.4.2 for Linux this problem seems to have disappeared after
introducing a workaround which resets the window size after each text update.
With other Java versions or on other systems the problem can still exist.

Problems with command completion in GTP shell on Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X
</title>
<para>
There are two known problems with Java 1.4.2 on Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X:
the popup menu sometimes overlaps the command field and selection from
the popup menu using the Enter key does not work.
It is recommended to disable command line completion on the Mac and to
select from the popup menu only using the mouse.

<title>Out of memory error when loading large SGF trees</title>
<para>
Java uses a low maximum memory heap size by default.
It can be increased by using the "-Xmx" option, e.g. for 512MB:
<programlisting>
<userinput>java -Xmx512M -jar gogui.jar</userinput>
</programlisting>
Don't use more memory than there is real memory on the machine,
because using swap space will make the program unusable slow.

<title>Wrong line numbers in SGF error messages</title>
<para>
If reading an SGF file fails, the line numbers of the error messages
are sometimes wrong.
This is due to bugs in the Java class StreamTokenizer that is used
for parsing the SGF stream.

<title>Rendering errors in the GTP shell</title>
<para>
Rendering errors in the GTP shell window occur which disappear after manually
resizing the window.
This is probably a bug in the Java libraries.
With Java 1.4.2 for Linux this problem seems to have disappeared after
introducing a workaround which resets the window size after each text update.
With other Java versions or on other systems the problem can still exist.

<title>Problems with command completion in GTP shell on Mac OS X</title>
<para>
There are two known problems with Java 1.4.2 on Mac OS X:
the popup menu sometimes overlaps the command field and selection from
the popup menu using the Enter key does not work.
It is recommended to disable command line completion on the Mac and to
select from the popup menu only using the mouse.

GoGui uses
<ulink url="http://www.rene-grothmann.de/jago/Documentation/xml.html">
Jago's XML format</ulink> for importing and exporting Go games in XML format.
Currently, only files containing a single GoGame element are supported.

The document type definition file as retrieved from
<ulink url="http://www.rene-grothmann.de/jago/Documentation/go.dtd">
http://www.rene-grothmann.de/jago/Documentation/go.dtd</ulink> in 10/2007 is
included in the GoGui package in src/net/sf/gogui/xml/go.dtd.
If a file is read with a DOCTYPE containing go.dtd as a local file, but the
local file cannot be found, this copy of go.dtd will be used for validation.

The following list documents how GoGui handles cases in which the
documentation for the XML format from the web page and the DTD file are
ambiguous or contradicting.

Pass moves are written as move elements with an empty string for the
at-property. Handling pass moves this way was first introduced by 
<ulink url="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/daniel.gilder/gosvg.html">
GoSVG</ulink>. Jago has read-support for pass moves since
version 5.0.

The XML documentation says that a paragraph element is optional
for comments that contain only a single paragraph, but go.dtd requires
them. GoGui will always store comments in a paragraph. When reading a file,
GoGui can handle the case of direct text in comments, as long its DOCTYPE
contains no DTD file or a DTD derived from go.dtd that allows direct text
in comments. However mixed text and paragraph elements are not supported.

The XML format contains no support for line-breaks in comments.
According to the documentation, paragraphs elements should handle text as
the HTML paragraph element. GoGui will replace a line-break by a new paragraph
when storing a file. When reading a file, line-breaks and empty lines are
trimmed. Other whitespace is never deleted when storing or reading a comment.

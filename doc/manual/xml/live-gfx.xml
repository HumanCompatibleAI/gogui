<para>
The Go engine can display graphical data on the Go board while a command
is in progress by writing draw commands to the standard error stream.
Every line that starts with <userinput>gogui-gfx:</userinput> is interpreted
by GoGui as a draw command using the same syntax as in the
<userinput>gfx</userinput> Analyze command type.
The additional command CLEAR can be used for clearing all markup.
If no draw command command follows immediately after
<userinput>gogui-gfx:</userinput>, all following lines until the next empty
line will be interpreted as draw commands.
See the <userinput>dummy_live_gfx</userinput> command in
<xref linkend="reference-gtpdummy"/> for an example.

<title>Analyze Commands</title>
  
<para>
GoGui allows to define analyze commands.
An analyze command corresponds to a GTP command and describes its parameters
and response type in a way that they can be invoked from the user interface
and the response be displayed graphically on the board.
</para>
  
<para>
Analyze commands can be run from the analyze dialog or (if they have a
single point and an optional color argument) from the context menu of a field
on the board.
In the analyze dialog, you can also select if the command should
automatically run after each change on the board, and if the board should
be cleared from results of previous commands before displaying the new
result.
</para>

<para>
The Go program can implement the GTP extension command
<command>gogui-analyze_commands</command>, which allows GoGui to query
program specific analyze commands from the program when a new program is
attached.
Otherwise a default configuration is used that knows some standard GTP
and GNU Go extension commands.
Analyze commands can also be defined in the
configuration file <filename>~/.gogui/analyze-commands</filename>
in the user's home directory.
</para>

<para>
An example configuration is the default configuration file
<filename>config/analyze-commands</filename> in the GoGui package.
The format consists of one line per command:
</para>
  
<programlisting>
<userinput>
type/label/command
</userinput>
</programlisting>
  
<section>
<title>Types</title>
<para>
The command type determines in what format the response is expected to be and
how it is interpreted and displayed.
It can be one of the following:

<variablelist>

<varlistentry>
<term><userinput>bwboard</userinput></term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
The response of the command is a board of strings.
Strings "b" or "black" will be displayed as black,
"w" or "white" as white, all other strings are not displayed.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><userinput>cboard</userinput></term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
The response of the command is a board of strings with color names.
They will be displayed as background colors for the fields.
Valid color names are black, blue, cyan, green, gray, magenta,
pink, red, white, and yellow or #rrggbb.
Unknown names or the special string "" are ignored.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><userinput>dboard</userinput></term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
The response of the command is a board of floating point
numbers that represent influence data.
They will be displayed as black (positive) and white (negative)
squares on the board.
The maximum size of a square is such that the corner would touch
the edge of a stone on that field; the edge length of the
square is proportional to the floating point number.
The numbers are expected to be between -1 and 1.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><userinput>eplist</userinput></term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Editable point list command.
The command is used to set a list of points.
It needs the following syntax:
the current point list is set, if the argument is a point list (or empty);
the current point list is shown, if the argument is "show".
GoGui always queries the current point list first, selects the points on the
board and allows the user to edit them, then it sends the command with the
selected points as the argument.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><userinput>gfx</userinput></term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
General graphical display commands.
The reponse contains one command and its arguments per line.
Commands are: BLACK, CIRCLE, COLOR, INFLUENCE, LABEL, MARK, SQUARE, TEXT,
TRIANGLE, VAR, WHITE.
TEXT is followed by a text displayed on the status bar;
LABEL arguments are point text pairs;
INFLUENCE arguments are point double pairs;
COLOR arguments are a color (like in cboard) and a point list;
VAR arguments are moves (b/w point/PASS);
all other commands take a point list.
See the <userinput>dummy_gfx</userinput> command in GtpDummy for an example.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><userinput>hstring</userinput></term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
The response is a multi-line text.
It will be displayed in a window using syntax highlighting.
Lines beginning with a word followed by a colon are displayed in bold,
points and moves in blue, the strings "black" and "white" in purple,
numbers in green, and words that are completely uppercase in red.
Syntax highlighting is disabled, if GoGui is started with option -fast.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>

</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><userinput>param</userinput></term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
The response to the command is a list of program parameters.
An dialog will be shown to edit the parameters.
Each line of the response must contain a key and value.
It must be possible to change a value using the same command, with the
key and new value as arguments.
Optionally, a line can have a type identifier for the value before the key.
Currently, the types "[string]" and "[bool]" (boolean parameter using "1" for
true and "0" for false) are supported.
No whitespaces are allowed in the parameter keys, but underscores will be
replaced by spaces in the labels of the dialog.

<title>Command</title>
<para>
The command to send to the Go program.
It can contain one of the following wildcards:
<variablelist>

<varlistentry>
<term><userinput>%c</userinput></term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Will be replaced by a color, which can be selected in the analyze window;
default is the color which is to play.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><userinput>%f</userinput></term>
<listitem>
<para>
Will be replaced by a filename entered by the user.
If the path to the file contains spaces, it will be quoted with double quotes.
<warning>
<simpara>
There are Go programs that implement filename arguments to GTP commands
in a way that does not allow the path to the file to contain spaces
(e.g. <command>printsgf</command> in GNU Go 3.6).
</simpara>
</warning>
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><userinput>%m</userinput></term>
<listitem>
<simpara>

</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><userinput>%o</userinput></term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
This wildcard is for commands that take an optional string argument and can
be used for querying or setting a parameter of the Go program.
The command should return the current value of the parameter, if no argument
is given, and set the parameter to the argument otherwise.
The command will be run first without an argument to retrieve the current
value, which is used as default value in an input box presented to the
user.
If the user changes the value, the command will be run with the new value
as an argument to set the parameter.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><userinput>%p</userinput></term>

<varlistentry>
<term><userinput>%P</userinput></term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Will be replaced by a list of points selected by the user.
The points are selected by clicking on the board.
The last point of the list is selected either by clicking with the
<keycap>Ctrl</keycap> key pressed, double-clicking, or using the right
mouse button.
</simpara>

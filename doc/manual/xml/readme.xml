<para>
GoGui is a graphical interface to programs that play the game of Go and use the
<ulink url="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~gunnar/gtp/">Go Text Protocol</ulink>.
</para>

<para>
It is especially useful for Go program developers, since it allows
direct communication with the program by sending any GTP command
and to log and save the stream of sent GTP commands
to facilitate debugging and reproducing errors.

<title>Notes on using GCJ</title>
<para>
The implementation of the javax.swing classes is incomplete in GCJ.
The current status (tested with GCJ 4.0.0) is:
everything compiles, the console based tools (e.g. GtpRegress, GtpDummy) seem
to work, the graphical programs GoGui and GtpDisplay don't work.
GtpDisplay seems to work mostly, but it does not make advantage of
Graphics2D based features (color gradient on stones).
It also throws a GTK error, when trying to pop up dialog windows.
GoGui is not usable yet, you can see, how far it works, by running it with:

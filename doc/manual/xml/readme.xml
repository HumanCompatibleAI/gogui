<para>
GoGui is a graphical interface to programs that play the game of Go and use
the
<ulink url="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~gunnar/gtp/">Go Text Protocol</ulink>.
</para>

<para>
It is especially useful for Go program developers, since it allows
direct communication with the program by sending any GTP command
and to log and save the stream of sent GTP commands
to facilitate debugging and reproducing errors.

<para>
GoGui requires Java 1.4.
It is mainly tested with Sun's JDK on Linux and on Mac OS/X.

<title>Using GCJ</title>
<para>
The current status (tested with GCJ 4.0.1) is:
everything compiles, the console based tools (e.g. GtpRegress, GtpDummy) seem
to work, the graphical programs GoGui, GtpDisplay and GtpStatistics (which
uses AWT classes for drawing plots) don't work yet.
However, the implementation of the Java Swing classes in the Classpath
library, which is used by GCJ, has been making tremendous progress recently,
so future versions will probably be able to run GoGui.

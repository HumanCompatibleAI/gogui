This directory contains Sun's implementation of the Java Communications
API. Only the file commapi/comm.jar is needed for compiling GmpToGtp,
but the Sun's license requires to distribute the whole software package,
so comm.jar is extracted from build.xml.

For actually running GmpToGtp you will need to install Communications
API, see the GmpToGtp reference for more information.

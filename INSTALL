Basic Installation
==================

This package requires at least Java version 1.4.
It comes with precompiled Java jar files for GoGui and the GTP tools
and in the lib directory.

For Unix systems there are launcher scripts in the bin directory.
The launcher scripts respect the environment variable JAVA_HOME, if defined,
and look for the jar files relative to the bin directory.


Compiling from the Sources
==========================

* Compiling GoGui from the sources needs the Ant build system
  (http://ant.apache.org).

* You will need the class files from the Java Communications API
  (http://java.sun.com/products/javacomm).
  Make sure that the class file "comm.jar" is somewhere in your class path.

* The HTML documentation is generated using Docbook.
  To re-generate the HTML files after changes in the XML files,
  you need to install the Docbook XSL files (http://docbook.sourceforge.net)
  and set the environment variable DOCBOOK_XSL_HOME to the installation
  directory.

* If all requirements are met, simply type "ant" in the main directory
  of GoGui.

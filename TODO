BUGS:

When using time left properties from a read SGF file, the father node
should also be considered, because the file could have only a time left
property for one color in each node.

GoGui: check if setup will capture anything and issue a warning, because setup
stones are transmitted to the program by play commands


IMPROVEMENTS:

Implement stream selector class similar to ANSI C select to replace
MessageQueue used in GtpClient

Consider using java.util.prefs for preferences

GtpRegress: change into gtp test file directory, optional?

GtpRegress: improve documentation (in/out file locations, relative paths)

latex export current variation, not main

BUGS:

GoGui: check if setup will capture anything and issue a warning, because setup
stones are transmitted to the program by play commands

var output: strings are not cleared when running a new var command


IMPROVEMENTS:

Game tree viewer should allow to hide variations and start with all
side variations hidden to allow loading large SGF trees like
GNU Go's SGF traces.

Implement search in node comments.

SquareLayout should be used in gui.Board

New analyze return type that automatically translates numbers (labels?)
to a color board with automatically assigned colors.

GtpRegress: change into gtp test file directory, optional?

GtpRegress: improve documentation (in/out file locations, relative paths)

latex export current variation, not main

BUGS:

GoGui: check if setup will capture anything and issue a warning, because setup
stones are transmitted to the program by play commands


IMPROVEMENTS:

Allow to use timeout in gtp.Gtp.waitForExit() to offer the user to
kill the program if it does not exit after its input stream is closed.

SquareLayout should be used in gui.Board

GtpRegress: change into gtp test file directory, optional?

GtpRegress: improve documentation (in/out file locations, relative paths)

latex export current variation, not main

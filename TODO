BUGS:



go.Board: allow setup at any time. GoGui: check if setup will
capture anything and issue a warning, because setup stones are transmitted
to the program by play commands


var output: strings are not cleared when running a new var command

computer resigns is not always shown (?), only game finished

latex export current variation, not main


IMPROVEMENTS:

GtpRegress: change into gtp test file directory, optional?

GtpRegress: improve documenation (in/out file locations, relative paths)

GoGui: destroy gametree window on close

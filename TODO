BUGS:

GoGui: check if setup will capture anything and issue a warning, because setup
stones are transmitted to the program by play commands

var output: strings are not cleared when running a new var command

computer resigns is not always shown (?), only game finished


IMPROVEMENTS:

New analyze return type that automatically translates numbers (labels?)
to a color board with automatically assigned colors.

GtpRegress: change into gtp test file directory, optional?

GtpRegress: improve documenation (in/out file locations, relative paths)

latex export current variation, not main

BUGS:

When using time left properties from a read SGF file, the father node
should also be considered, because the file could have only a time left
property for one color in each node.


MAYBE LATER:

GtpRegress: change into gtp test file directory, optional?

GtpRegress: improve documentation (in/out file locations, relative paths)

latex export current variation, not main

latex export using igo.sty (optional)

BUGS:

if program startup fails, detach menu is disabled (program should not
be automatically detached for allowing to read errors in GTP shell) 

GoGui: check if setup will capture anything and issue a warning, because setup
stones are transmitted to the program by play commands


IMPROVEMENTS:

Consider using java.util.prefs for preferences

SquareLayout should be used in gui.Board

GtpRegress: change into gtp test file directory, optional?

GtpRegress: improve documentation (in/out file locations, relative paths)

latex export current variation, not main

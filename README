GoGui is a graphical interface to programs that play the game of Go
and use GTP (Go Text Protocol).

It is especially useful for Go program developers, since it allows
direct communication with the program by sending any GTP command
and allows to log and save the complete stream of sent GTP commands
to facilitate debugging and reproducing errors.

GoGui requires Java 1.4.
